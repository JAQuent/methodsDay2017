##RMarkdown workflow

![Taken from http://bioconnector.org/workshops/r-rmarkdown.html](rmarkdown-workflowSmall.png).

## Pros 
* Reproducibility: RMarkdown can be used to make scientific analysis more reproducible. 
* Track and avoid mistkakes:
      * Rounding p-value,
      * Copy & paste,
      * Forgetting to up update statistic.

## Contra
* Sometimes things go wrong when you try to knit a document to .html file, when it was written to be knit a .pdf file (see workflow). 
* You will frequently need to ask for help for more intricate stuff for instance on [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).
* List of references are generated at the end of the script. Some journal want to have the figures etc. at the end.
